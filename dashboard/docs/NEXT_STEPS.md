# Component next steps

<!-- WORKSPACE-VERIFICATION:START -->
## Component verification continuation

Updated 2026-10-05. Install/start commands and actual screenshots are in [README](../README.md).

## home-platform-dashboard / web

Startup: **opened**. Startup evidence only; candidate flows not run. Production acceptance is not established.

Candidate flow (not run): Navigate Now, Projects, Automations, Data and System against a fixture backend; verify connection recovery and status semantics. Do not execute live automation controls.

Fixture setup: Synthetic data and isolated storage. Use mock/emulator auth, API, mail and paid-provider endpoints. No live automation, deletion of user data, or external submissions.

Codex: Turn this candidate into a fixture-backed simulated flow with explicit assertions and capture its result.

User: Review the app purpose and screenshot; decide whether to ship it, retain it as an experiment, consolidate it, or nominate it for archival. Supply required account/device judgment after automated fixtures pass.
